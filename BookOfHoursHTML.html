But historical monks and nuns had a way of traversing large distances for their calling: take for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabban_Bar_Sauma">Rabban Bar Sauma</a>. The Holy Roman Empire sat at the crossroads between trade routes connecting North Africa, the British Isles, the Mediterranean, the Levant, Eastern Europe, etc...</p>

            <li>
              <p><em>Race</em> as we are familiar with is an invention of the 18th century. It would be confusing to a medieval peasant whose ethnic identity is based on in the village he was born in and his first language.</p>

            <li>
              <p>The Priory uses <strong>Liturgical Latin</strong> in official business.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Some <strong>Vulgar Latin</strong> may creep in when they are speaking more casually, with influence from Romance languages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sisters born in the local area speak <strong>High German</strong> in common conversation, the <em>lingua franca</em> of the Holy Roman Empire.<br><sub>Subprioress Sister Maria Dolorosa disapproves of this, if anything not said in Latin is not “necessary” to the running of the convent and “tempting us to idle gossip,” but she’s the worst OC in the group anyway and her RPer is annoying, so just ignore her.</sub></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Most nuns practice <strong>monastic sign language</strong> within areas of the Priory where unnecessary speech is limited according to the rule of St Benedict. It can be adopted more widely for sisters who are hard of hearing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Outside the convent in the wider Empire, people spoke languages including but not limited to: various German dialects (Swabian, Alsatian, Swiss, Luxembourgish), Dutch, Yiddish, Danish, Frisian, French, Provencal, Italian, Romansh, Sinte Romani, Slovenian, Czech-Moravian, Sorbian, Pomeranian, Polish, and various Latins.</p>
            </li>

        <h2>Given Name</h2>
        <p><span><mark><strong>Will my character need to take a new name when they join the Priory?</strong></mark> <br> No. The Schönbruck Prioress believes that the nun vocation is tied to one’s baptismal name, not necessarily the new name they adopt. (Which is historically accurate depending on the Order! Don’t come for me!)<br><br /> <mark><strong>OK, but I want my character to take on a new name.</strong></mark> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In that case, I lied, and your nun must change their name. (Which is historically accurate depending on the Order! This is very convenient, isn’t it?)</span><span class="p">If you want a character with a name not commonly used anymore, this group is your chance. Note that saint names reign supreme for characters that are born Christian; just because a name is featured in the Bible doesn’t mean it was used in the Middle Ages.</span></p>

              <p>A popular medieval tradition is to name your child after their birthday’s Feast Day. For example, a baby girl born on July 20 could be named Margaret after the Feast of St Margaret that day. If you want to choose a name this way, look at this <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Moveable_and_Fixed_Feast_Day_Calendars_for_Germany">Feast Days in Germany</a> page, scroll down to the bottom, and select your character’s birth month.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Bad at birthdays? Do this in reverse! Find a saint that shares your character’s name and check when their feast day is. Sister Maria Dolorosa’s name refers to Our Lady of Sorrows, an iteration of the Virgin Mary, whose feast day falls on September 15. That’s her birthday now, I guess!</p>

        <h3>Surname</h3>
        <p><span class="p">Sisters in the convent sever all ties to the material world when they take their habit. A sister named Elizabeth from Nuremberg in Germany would simply be Sister Elizabeth of Nuremberg.<br><br /> Childhood? That’s another matter. She might have been “Elizabeth Bäcker” or “Elizabeth Baker,” to acknowledge that her father is the town baker. She may have a nickname in town or the Priory that sticks: for example, “Elizabeth the Short,” “Elizabeth Younger,” or “Elizabeth Quarrelsome.” Have fun with it!</span></p>
        <h3>The Habit</h3>
        <p><blockquote>“Do not wear stunning clothes, anything having a pleat, for the eye is curious before and behind, and do not wear dresses that billow. Be careful of clothes carefully and diligently patterned and bought at a very high price, for that is the care of the flesh, that is the eager desire of eyes… use garments that cover the body, that conceal the maidenly decorum… that keep out the rigors of cold; not those that produce the incentive and capacity for lust.”</p>
        <p>— Bishop Leander of Seville, writing to his abbess sister Florentina circa 600 AD</blockquote></p>

        <p><span class="p"><strong>Highly encouraged</strong> if it&#39;s in-character, but know that many sticklers will disapprove. Wink.</span><span class="p">Benedictines attracted quite a bit of criticism at various points in history for lax standards on dress. Many nuns developed a tradition of expressing themselves through their headdresses by precise folding, fluting, pleating, and draping. Some communities embroidered biblical mottoes along the edges of the veil and designed heavy, rigid coifs that would cause the veil to cascade around the head and body in precise patterns. Some nuns used ribbons and frills as decorative edging.</span><span class="p">Fontevrault Abbey specified that the underveil and wimple should not be seen from beneath the veil, that the tunic be made from coarse undyed wool, that sleeve length not extend past the wrists, and that fringes and gloves not permitted. ... Which implies there were many nuns in France at the time doing the opposite. Another abbott ranted at length about Hildegard von Bingen permitting her nuns to wear golden hairpins, silver belts, jeweled rings, laced shoes, brightly colored cloth, long trains, and furs. Do with this what you will.</span></p>

        <p><span class="p">We want to avoid character overlap and forcing our members to do mind-numbingly boring research on daily life in Medieval convents. So, we are using a <strong>two-fold reservation system.</strong></span><span class="p">First, you will claim your player character’s <strong>job</strong> within the priory. This is comparable to a class in Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Your character’s position in the priory grants them access to rooms otherwise locked, occupation-specific knowledge, and sometimes items.</span></p>

                <p><span class="p"><mark><strong>The Almoner.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Resides in the gatehouse during the daytime Hours. Provides food, medicine, money, and clothing to the poor. Manages the guesthouse for visitors. The Almoner is the face of the Priory to the outside world, and the first to hear of any incoming news.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Anchoress.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Resides in the cell attached to the refectory. She has sworn a vow to spiritually “die,” and been permanently entombed in an anchorite’s cell attached to the chapel. Reserve this one if you have no time to RP except in long one-on-one paragraphs. I’ll let you do it. No, seriously. It sounds awesome.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Cellaress.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oversees the kitchen of the priory and manages all rationing, meal planning, ingredients, and kitchen staff. She also oversees the priory gardens where food is grown, the mill where flour is ground, tenant farms owned by the Priory, and decides in part what livestock we’re involved in. The Cellaress was one of the most powerful women in a monastic community below the Prioress and Sub-Prioress. Reserve this one if you want to be the cook-landlord. The Cooklord, if you will.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Chambress.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oversees the dormitories. In charge of clothing, laundry, vestments of the church, and bedding. She ensures nuns have clean proper-sized clothes and mattresses to sleep on, and ensures they are routinely re-stuffed with hay. She also oversees the guesthouse when there are visitors and assists the Cellaress in the kitchens. Most convents are not wealthy places; The Chambress has a responsibility in lean times to “mend and make do,” but this can be a source of vital revenue for the Priory if the Chambress is quick with a needle and can create beautiful embroidery that fetches a high price. Reserve this one if you want to be the tradwife who finds people’s stashes.<br><br /> <mark><strong>♂ The Chaplain.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nuns are self-sufficient in all but one respect: they cannot preach Mass, and more importantly, receive Holy Communion without a priest. Because of this, a priest is appointed to hear confession and give Mass once a day. The Chaplain has a valuable role in the story, if reserved and used: he has access to the world of men and the mother-house for investigation. You can imagine the outrage that will occur if The Chaplain is young and handsome! If you want to be amused, please review the recommended guidelines for modern-day convent chaplains.</span><span class="p"><mark><strong>The Infirmaress.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oversees the infirmary. Cares for the sick, those recuperating after bloodletting, and elderly sisters unable to observe the full rigors of monastic life a bit like a nursing home. She also tends to the herb garden and has a wide-ranging knowledge of remedies. The Infirmaress also oversees quarterly blood-letting, done to balance the humors, though she should be aware that oftentimes nuns may fake sick in order to indulge in warmth and meat. Reserve this one if you like hurt/comfort roleplays and want to run the bloodletting event. Sorry, I’m kidding, I mean if you want to be the doctor.</span><span class="p"><mark><strong>The Librarian.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oversees the library. The Priory’s annalist, archivist, chronicler, and book-mistress. She maintains the mortuary roll, containing the list of names of the dead for whose souls the priory was paid to pray. She keeps track of books borrowed and returned by the sisters and is responsible for what the sisters read, both publicly and privately, as well as for what is read aloud during mealtimes. She also manages the scriptorium, where sisters illuminate and copy manuscripts. Reserve this one if you want to tailor the meal readings to call out post specific characters and be the human encyclopedia.</span></p>

              <div>
                <p><span class="p"><mark><strong>The Novice.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; A girl who has not taken her vows between the ages of eleven and seventeen — this one is a bit flexible. Anyone who wishes to become a nun undergos a trial period of one year where they live amongst lay-boarders and familiarize themselves with the rules of the Priory. Novices have made a commitment to the Priory and must obey its rules, but play an interesting role because they have not forsaken their ties to the material world. They retain all land holdings, titles and properties. Reserve this one if you want your big sisters to boss you around and do their chores.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Oblate.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; This could be an aristocratic lay-boarder who is being educated by the convent, a daughter being sequestered (or punished) until her father can find her a husband, or a child who has not yet taken vows and is still learning her Latin. She does much of the drudgery of the convent and functions as a lay-servant while learning much of what is required to be a nun. The Oblate has a key edge over her older compatriots: children are often invisible and can go where adults cannot. If The Oblate chooses to begin her road to sisterhood and stay in the convent permanently, she will make oblation and become The Novice. Reserve this one if you want to roleplay the token kid, or the token Princess-in-a-tower.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Precentrix.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; The precentrix or <em>cantor</em>, is the Priory’s music and art director. She conducts music performed during the Liturgy of the Hours, choir practices and rehearses the readers for mealtimes. She oversees the production of convent plays, which are put on during important feast days for the nuns’ and visitor’s entertainment. Naturally, she usually has one of the sweetest singing voices in the cloister and a sharp ear for pitch – which means she might hear things that others cannot. Reserve The Precentrix if you want to be the Drama Teacher of the convent.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Sacrist.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Manages the sacristy, as well as the treasury and accounting. Responsible for all supplies within the priory and church especially. She manages the use of candles and oil in the dormitory, balances the accounts, sounds the bell for mealtimes, and assists in the making of hosts and wine for the Eucharist. The church sacristy is the heart of all valuables; there is lots of gold and silver, meaning that a sacrist ought to know how to secure buildings against thieves. When something goes missing, she will be the first to notice. Reserve this one if you want to be the Office Services Manager.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Scribe.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Resides in the scriptorium, where she works to dutifully copy and illuminate Bibles, Psalters, and small devotional Book of the Hours (roll credits). In this time period, demand increases for personal libraries from the wealthy, and this work is a valuable source of income. Because the Scribe must mimic the precise wording and typesetting of the example text to the letter, she has a keen eye for handwriting analysis and Biblical allusion.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Subprioress.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Second-in-command only to the Prioress, the Subprioress assists in her duties of ministering to the spiritual needs of the flock. She accompanies her on journeys to the Abbott, writes her letters, and makes the rounds of the cloisters to see if anything is amiss and whether the brethren are intent on their work. She had no authority to correct or punish the brethren but can report to the Prioress whatever she finds amiss or contrary to the rules. She also mods the campaign. Woah, what was that? I think the fourth wall cracked a bit.</span></p>

        <div container02" class="container columns">
          <div class="wrapper">
            <div class="inner">
              <div>
                <p><span class="p"><mark><strong>The Aristocrat.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; A Princess of the now-powerless House of Hohenstaufen — the daughter of a despised Habsburg Duke — the sister of a local Graf near Stuttgart... Her family is a powerful patron of the priory and may have even founded it. Because of this, she experiences lighter consequences, something she has in common with <em>The Cleric</em>. She can read and write multiple languages, ride horses, manage a large estate’s accounting, and still remembers how to rub shoulders with the upper-class despite her vow of poverty. Some lower-class folk may bristle at her privilege and manners, which can be seen as condescending and out-of-touch. Many nuns historically came from aristocracy. If there is enough interest, two slots might become available.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Asylee.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; War. Famine. Pestilence. Plague. Death. Fire. Flood. Something terrible happened to this sister in her old land, whether at a previous nunnery or in her secular life. After everything she witnessed, this sister embraces a simple life of quiet contemplation and views the priory as a sanctuary. While her experiences may leave her tight-lipped, jumpy, and prone to night terrors that may terrify and disturb her sisters, she is reliable in a crisis and reacts quickly. She, better than anybody else, will be equipped when the pale horse of Death comes knocking on the door of the Priory. After all — she has seen this before. She cannot stand by and permit it to happen again.<br><br /> <s><mark><strong>The Cistercian.</strong></mark></s>&nbsp; &nbsp; A nun that did poorly in austerity – a nun whose convent was dissolved – a nun that was promoted. The Cistercians branched off from the Benedictines 200 years ago, believing that their original order had deviated from the Rule of St Benedict. Who can blame them when you see Princess-Abbesses flouncing around in rings? The Cistercians follow a stricter version of the laws that govern the Priory, and while they may be a Benedictine now, the urge to walk cold and barefoot on the cold stone floors in the winter persists. Her sisters regard her as an overly-rigid prude who loves to suffer.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Convert.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; An <em>anusim</em> forced to convert who practices in secret — a morisco — A Sinti woman who hears the call — a Muslim from Al-Andalus who feels spiritually indebted to a nun who saved her life. People convert for belief, for love, fear, convenience, or even financial reasons! The Prioress of Schonbruck says that the Lord is our shepherd and he turns no souls away from his flock. The Medieval Inquisition disagrees, and many countries will begin to attempt various expulsions in the centuries to come. The Convert often finds herself torn between her spiritual calling and the faith that raised her, but this outsider’s perspective on the sometimes-stifling world within the convent may very well prove key to solving the mystery.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Foreigner.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; A Christian Moor — a Saracen — an Ethiopian… This sister hails from a territory considered exotic to the smallfolk of Schönbruck. Her name, face or both mark her as otherized during a time when Orientalist tall tales from far-off lands run rampant. While she may have to waste valuable time explaining where she’s really from to curious children, a distinct appearance can also prove useful; as any member of a diaspora will tell you, being able to speak a traveller’s language or share their homeland gives you a special bond. She retains fluency of her native tongue and knowledge of travel and trade routes, but may struggle with the local dialect and find the town may marginalize her from lack of understanding – something The Spare or The Prisoner may empathize with. Though Galatians says we all are one in Christ Jesus, her background may cause her sisters to cast their suspicions on her first.<br><br /> <s><mark><strong>The Foundling.</strong></mark></s>&nbsp; &nbsp; Discovered in the woods as a sacrifice for the Pagan gods — left on the stoop of the town church — exposed on a mountainside in winter, nearly dead. A parent may abandon their child because of stigma around teen pregnancy, wedlock, poverty, homelessness, sickness, physical disability, or death of the mother. Discovering over the course of the story the reason they were abandoned may provide them closure — or it may make it worse. These children are taken in by the priory, fed and clothed. They are given a good (but pious) education. The unspoken agreement is that in exchange for taking this sister in as a child, she is morally obligated to repay her debt to the priory. To rejoin secular society is out of the question, for aren’t they the ones who rejected you in the first place? A childhood spent running around the priory means she knows its nooks, crannies, and secret passageways better than most. It also means The Foundling is a complete idiot about anything outside the priory. Think Rapunzel from Tangled.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Spare.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; The youngest of ten children given up for religious service according to ninth century custom — from a family of all girls — bastard-born — has a sickness or disability that causes society to discount her. Families were large in the Middle Ages. For many, lots of daughters meant lots of dowries, and lots of dowries meant unaffordable expense. When girls are no longer needed for marriage alliances, labour or chores, it may be cheaper and more spiritually commendable for the family to get thee to a nunnery than cough up for another dowry, giving The Spare something in common with The Pawn. The Spare might have her eye on a husband before the choice was made for her, or she may have acquiesced quite happily. If she has a chronic condition or disability, she may find it is better accommodated in the Priory than it was at home. Physical ailments were thought to place you closer to God in suffering (… The Zealot might say, but The Spare may not concur), while some neurological conditions were thought to be insight from the Holy Spirit. The Rule of Saint Benedict makes accommodations for the sick such as permitting meat during mealtimes. Her marginalized background may give her compassion and knowledge about the material conditions of the ailing poor and needy, making her an excellent caregiver, teacher or almoner.<br></span></p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p><span class="p"><mark><strong>The Cleric.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; You merely adopted the habit. She was born into it. Molded by it. Clergy might be banned from inheriting property or have children, but that doesn’t stop clerical dynasties and nepotist hires from flourishing across Europe. She may be the illegitimate daughter of a bishop and his “housekeeper” — her brother or uncle may be an ecclesiastical bureaucrat, or even a Cardinal — she may be related to the Abbott responsible for their Priory! She has what The Pawn wants. Like The Aristocrat, consequences for The Cleric are not harsh, lasting or permanent. Who’s going to punish the niece of the archbishop, after all? There may already be whispers of intentions to make her the new Prioress when her body is barely cold. Her connections in high places give her an excellent grasp of theology and advance warning of Vatican interference in the Priory. Sure, she’s a nepo baby, but it pays to have the nepo baby on your side.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Pawn.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; This sister’s family desires higher standing with the clergy – a promotion for their son to Bishop – a title – to spy on the comings and goings of the Priory – more land – to pay less taxes to the church. Regardless of reason, The Pawn&#39;s family has gifted this sister to the priory to position themselves politically. Like The Aristocrat, she knows some creature comfort. Unlike The Aristocrat, this sister was not permitted to become a nun from the goodness of her parent’s heart or to fulfill a family legacy and may not even be willing. Growing up in a family of schemers perpetually in debt means this sister might be shrewd, worldly or cynical. She’s skilled with coin, barter, lie detection and convincing others. Unlike many clergy, she is all too aware of the sinful world outside the Priory and uses it to her advantage, whether she is personally comfortable doing so.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Prisoner.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Prisoner violated a thirteenth-century social norm and pays the price with the habit. She may have fallen pregnant – she may be a scold, a drunkard, a brothel-keeper, a thief or petty criminal, accused of witchcraft, a gossip, a harlot, or drawn the eye of another woman’s husband. The Asylee cherishes the priory as her safe harbour, but for The Prisoner, this is a penal colony. Punishments for women in the Middle Ages ranged from humiliating at best to torture and death at worst. The Prioress may have interceded on The Prisoner’s behalf, asking amnesty in exchange for The Prisoner taking vows and atoning for her sins with prayer and charity. Uniquely, The Prisoner can be combined with a modified version of The Oblate or The Novice if you wish to play a character who is pleading the belly.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Bride.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Most women in the thirteenth century had two choices upon adulthood: marriage or the habit. This sister turned her back on the former at the last minute, leaving only the latter as the only socially acceptable option. Her would-be husband may have been a rake, old enough to be her grandfather, or a cruel man. She might prefer the company of women, or the idea of marital relations at all may turn her stomach. She might fear having children or know that doing so would put her life at risk. Her faith might be insincere, or only sincere as far as she is thankful to the priory for providing a separate way of life. She may be scholastically inclined, and delight in having a place where she can study. A sister entering the priory this way is remarkably flexible, though admittedly indecisive.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Mystic.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; This sister goes into fits of ecstasy — may see religious visions — dreams vividly with messages from Heaven – has attained oneness through God at times through what we would see as meditation today. This was a popular spiritual movement in the region. The life of a mystic is a blessing and terrible burden. The Mystic is blessed with supernatural insight that permits her to see clues, patterns, and ways of thinking beyond that of the convent. Yet to be granted messages from God may draw ire and jealousy from sisters, or even be considered disruptive to service. Her experiences could in modern-day be diagnosed as mania, disorganized thinking, dissociation, migraine or epilepsy, all of which come with their own challenges. Furthermore, the visions the sister may be beholden to may not be in line with theological teachings, putting her at risk of heresy and investigations by the Inquisition nearly as much as The Convert.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Widow.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Widow has loved and lost – or married and murdered. There were many ways for one’s husband to die in the Middle Ages, but not all of them left his widow impoverished. Like The Bride, this may be the widow’s only option. Her husband may have an excellent dower set up for the care of his wife after his death, which certain other family members may like the widow to revoke so they can lay claim to it. Many aristocratic women retired to the same abbeys they were patrons of in their old age after many children, bringing with them their gold and jewels and patronage! The Widow is an object of fascination in the Priory. She has known many milestones forbidden to the others: the touch of a husband, the birth of children, the independence of running her own household.</span><span class="p">(Note that the Benedictine Order in this time only permitted widows with no, or non-dependent children. Come talk to me if you want this.<br><br /> <mark><strong>The Zealot.</strong></mark>&nbsp; &nbsp; Like The Bride, she scorns marriage and embraces monasticism. Unlike the Bride, her marriage was always to Christ and she never lets you forget it. The Zealot always dreamt of devoting her life to God. As a child she may have taken it to extremes. She may have gone without food or drink for long periods of time, terrifying her parents – she may have impressive, obsessive knowledge of the scriptures and God in a way we may recognize today as neurodivergent – she may give away copious amounts of money, food and clothes to the poor in her town without permission -- she may have even disguised herself as a young boy to try and join a monastery. While modern euphoric website users might see The Zealot as illogical or brainwashed, she can be quite the opposite. The Zealot has ambition and drive to spare. She refuses to retire to a quiet life and actively participates in intellectual society. Her passion and charisma are infectious. She easily bears the burden of Benedictine Rule easier than her sisters, giving her good survivability, but beware: her peers may not take kindly to her suggesting that the Priory is too comfortable, and that our beds should be harder and our meals sparser?</span></p>
